/* So we want aside nav to have gaps between all sections that increase
always with screen height, and at a certain screen height reach around 2rem
and stop decreasing there. ANSWER: GAPS are min(screen height dvh, rem)!!! 
If possible we then want the gaps between items to shrink for a little bit
with the screen height and then after that stop. 
ANSWER: A very clever calc(minrem, screen height, maxrem) whereby our 
maxrem picks up off the minrem on the above "ANSWER" and uses the same dvh
unit to pick up immediately
Finally we want the items to shrink to a certain size and then stop
finally causing an overflow. ANSWER: Another calc() 
NOTE: If possible to move them one after another then please figure that
out but please also see about moving all at the same time and what
the differences in the two approaches are.  */
